# 0022-markdown-previewer 

This was a fun project that I did while gaining the Front End Development Libraries Certification from freeCodeCamp coding bootcamp.  

I actually enjoined a lot into making this project. Because I personally love Markdown and I do take a lot of notes in Markdown.  

I enjoy taking notes in Markdown because it is such a powerful little markup language. And for taking notes it is perfect!  

While building this project I used 'marked' library to parse the text from the textarea element because it was a lot faster to develop instead to write my own markdown parser which I could... but it would have taking me more unnecesarry time.  
This is the library that I used: 
[marked npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked)

And additionally I added 6 themes to this App.  
Because I thought that would be fun!  
And It was pretty fun to change the colors and fonts dynamically.  

Thank You for checking out my personal project.
